Choose one of you neighbors, and ask her/him :

"What do you think of using a namespace instead of a class
to represent fixed point values ? I mean, with a scoped typedef
on int, we could write scoped functions and save the cost of
instanciations, but at the same time, we’d loose some handy
syntax. What’s your point of view ?"

This exercice won’t give you points. It’s just a little break
in the day to take time to look back at what you learned during
the past three days.

If you want to skip this, fine. I don’t care. You will probably
end up being a web developper anyway >.> !
